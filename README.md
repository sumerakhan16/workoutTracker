# Workout Tracker
# Purpose of the project
The purpose of creating the workout tracker is to allow users to have a neat and clean layout to  track what exercises have been complete. It will help users see a clear list of the workouts the y have completed. It allows users to chose specific information such as type of workout and weight size. All the information for each individual update will be saved and the page may be revisited without losing any content. 

# How to use the project
To use this application, start by adding a workout. Then answer questions regarding exercise type, weight, duration and more.

# Code highlights
A highlight would be the way it lists out how the workout details in a card in the center of the page.

# Areas of improvement
An area of improvment would be the workout dashboard rendering info to page.
